# E-Bazzar
A simple web application developed using Spring web MVC for E-commerce where customer can browse and select products and add item to cart and save and checkout the items. I have used credit card as payment gateway and use Card Verification System to verify the card and has used rule engine for different validation purpose.

How to run the project?
First import the mainStringMvc and then add the external jars provided in the ExternalsJars folder and then install mySql and copy the database manage folder in mySql folder then run the startMySql and run  and then you can enjoy shopping.
